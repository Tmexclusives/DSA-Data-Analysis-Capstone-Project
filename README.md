# DSA-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project

This is my first Portfolio Building class Project at the end of the Incubator Hub Digital Skillup Africa Data Analysis Program

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL, Power BI and now to my Portfolio Building uploading my very first Project.

On this Project, I was required to select any 2 out of a 3 case studies shared with me for the project. 
For each selected case study, I carried out a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the appropriate analytical tools and techniques relevant to the context of each dataset.
