# DSA-Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project

This is my first Portfolio Building class Project at the end of the Incubator Hub Digital Skillup Africa Data Analysis Program

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL, Power BI and now to my Portfolio Building uploading my very first Project.

On this Project, I was required to select any 2 out of a 3 case studies shared with me for the project. 
For each selected case study, I carried out a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the appropriate analytical tools and techniques relevant to the context of each dataset.

## Project Topic 1: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview
 
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement for a company named RetailTech Insights which provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon.

### Data Sources

The primary source of Data used here is the Amazon case study.xlsx file shared in class for the purpose of this project.

### Tools Used

- Ms Excel for Data Collection, Cleaning and Data Manipulation [Download Here](https://microsoft-excel.en.softonic.com/)
- SQL Server for Querying and Analysis [Download Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install)
- Power BI to Create a report [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/downloads)

 ### Data Cleaning and Preparation

 1. Data loading and Inspection
 2. Handling missing variables
 3. Data Cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?  
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 
4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, 
₹200–₹500, >₹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

### Data Analysis

In my Data Analysis, I used several Ms Excel functions and commands such as:
- =MAX(R4:R30)
